# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes HaramBlur's content detection and blocking capabilities with improved gender detection algorithms, faster blur performance, enhanced accuracy for inappropriate content, full-screen warnings, and built-in porn site blocking with Islamic guidance. The enhancement focuses on providing more accurate, faster, and comprehensive protection while maintaining the app's Islamic values and privacy-first approach.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Muslim user, I want improved gender detection algorithms so that male content is properly excluded from blurring when I disable male blur in settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN male blur is disabled in settings THEN the system SHALL accurately identify and exclude male faces/bodies from blur detection
2. WHEN gender detection is performed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% accuracy in distinguishing between male and female content
3. WHEN processing images with mixed gender content THEN the system SHALL selectively blur only the gender types enabled in user settings
4. IF gender detection confidence is below 80% THEN the system SHALL default to the user's safer filtering preference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user concerned about performance, I want ultra-fast blur processing so that the app responds immediately without lag even on older devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ultra-fast mode is enabled THEN blur processing SHALL complete within 50ms per frame
2. WHEN processing content on devices with 2GB RAM THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 30+ FPS blur rendering
3. WHEN multiple detection algorithms run simultaneously THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 15% on target devices
4. WHEN blur intensity is adjusted THEN the change SHALL be applied in real-time without frame drops

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing content with multiple inappropriate elements, I want the entire screen to be blurred with a warning dialog so that I can make an informed decision about continuing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inappropriate content density exceeds 40% of screen area THEN the system SHALL apply full-screen blur overlay
2. WHEN full-screen blur is triggered THEN the system SHALL display a warning dialog with "Close" and "Continue" options
3. WHEN "Continue" is selected THEN the system SHALL enforce a mandatory 15-second reflection period before allowing access
4. WHEN "Close" is selected THEN the system SHALL immediately close the current app/page
5. WHEN the warning dialog is displayed THEN the system SHALL include Islamic guidance text encouraging reflection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Muslim user seeking protection from explicit websites, I want automatic blocking of known pornographic sites so that I am prevented from accessing harmful content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to visit known pornographic websites THEN the system SHALL immediately block access
2. WHEN a pornographic site is blocked THEN the system SHALL display a relevant Quranic verse about purity and self-control
3. WHEN site blocking occurs THEN the system SHALL provide reflection time with Islamic guidance before allowing navigation away
4. WHEN the blocked site list is updated THEN new sites SHALL be automatically included without user configuration
5. IF a legitimate site is incorrectly blocked THEN the system SHALL provide a way to report false positives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who values privacy, I want all enhanced detection and blocking to work locally without sending data to external servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gender detection algorithms are improved THEN all processing SHALL remain 100% local on device
2. WHEN pornographic site blocking is active THEN site matching SHALL use local database without external queries
3. WHEN Quranic verses are displayed THEN content SHALL be stored locally and not fetched from internet
4. WHEN detection accuracy is enhanced THEN no user data or browsing patterns SHALL be transmitted externally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants customizable protection, I want granular settings for the new detection features so that I can adjust the system to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing detection settings THEN the system SHALL provide separate controls for male/female detection sensitivity
2. WHEN configuring blur performance THEN the system SHALL offer performance presets (Ultra Fast, Balanced, High Quality)
3. WHEN setting content density thresholds THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of full-screen blur trigger percentage
4. WHEN managing reflection periods THEN the system SHALL allow customization of mandatory wait times (5-30 seconds)
5. IF advanced settings are modified THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview of detection behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want the enhanced algorithms to integrate seamlessly with existing architecture so that performance and stability are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new detection algorithms are implemented THEN they SHALL integrate with existing MLModelManager and ContentDetectionEngine
2. WHEN site blocking is added THEN it SHALL work through the existing AccessibilityService without requiring additional permissions
3. WHEN full-screen warnings are displayed THEN they SHALL use the existing BlurOverlayManager architecture
4. WHEN Quranic content is added THEN it SHALL be stored using existing data layer patterns with proper localization support
