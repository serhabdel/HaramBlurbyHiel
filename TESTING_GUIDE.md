## 📱 Testing the App

### 1. Install and Setup

```bash
# Build the APK
cd /path/to/HaramBlur
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device/emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 2. Enable Accessibility Service

1. **Open the app** - Launch HaramBlur
2. **Follow setup instructions** - Tap "Open Accessibility Settings" 
3. **Enable the service**:
   - Find "HaramBlur" in accessibility services list
   - Toggle it ON
   - Tap "Allow" when prompted
4. **Return to app** - You should see "HaramBlur Active" status

### 3. Test Content Detection

The app will now automatically:
- 📸 **Capture screenshots** every 1-2 seconds
- 🧠 **Analyze content** using ML models
- 👤 **Detect faces** in real-time
- 🔍 **Check for inappropriate content** (simulated)
- 🟦 **Show blur overlays** when needed

### 4. Monitor Logs

Use Android Studio or ADB to monitor the detection in action:

```bash
# Watch HaramBlur logs
adb logcat | grep "HaramBlur"

# Key log tags to watch:
# - HaramBlurService: Main service operations
# - ScreenCaptureManager: Screenshot activity  
# - ContentDetectionEngine: Analysis results
# - FaceDetectionManager: Face detection
# - BlurOverlayManager: Overlay rendering
```

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

### When Service is Active:
```
D/HaramBlurService: HaramBlur Accessibility Service Connected
D/HaramBlurService: Initializing HaramBlur components...
D/HaramBlurService: Starting content monitoring...
D/ScreenCaptureManager: Screen capture started with 1000ms interval
```

### During Content Analysis:
```
D/ScreenCaptureManager: Screenshot captured: 1080x2400
D/HaramBlurService: Processing screen content: 1080x2400
D/FaceDetectionManager: Starting face detection on 1080x2400 bitmap
D/FaceDetectionManager: Face detection completed: 2 faces found
D/ContentDetectionEngine: Analysis result: shouldBlur=true, regions=2
D/HaramBlurService: Blur overlay activated for 2 regions
```

### Face Detection Working:
- Faces detected → Gray blur rectangles appear over face regions
- No faces → No blur overlay shown
- Multiple faces → Multiple blur rectangles

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Face Blur Test
1. **Open camera app or photos with faces**
2. **Expected**: Gray blur rectangles appear over detected faces
3. **Logs**: `Faces detected: X` messages

### Scenario 2: Content Analysis Test  
1. **Browse different apps** (browser, gallery, social media)
2. **Expected**: Continuous analysis without lag or crashes
3. **Logs**: Regular processing messages every 1-2 seconds

### Scenario 3: Performance Test
1. **Use device normally for 10+ minutes**
2. **Expected**: Smooth operation, no excessive battery drain
3. **Check**: CPU usage < 15%, RAM usage < 100MB additional

### Scenario 4: Service Recovery Test
1. **Disable/enable accessibility service**
2. **Expected**: Service restarts cleanly
3. **Logs**: Proper initialization and cleanup messages

## 📊 Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Works Now:
- **Accessibility service registration and lifecycle**
- **Real-time screen capture** (simulated for API < 30)
- **Face detection** using Google ML Kit
- **Blur overlay rendering** over detected regions
- **Content analysis pipeline** with proper error handling
- **Performance optimization** with processing cooldowns
- **Clean architecture** with dependency injection

### 🚧 Placeholder Systems:
- **NSFW Detection**: Uses simulated confidence scores
- **Screen Screenshots**: Creates simulated captures on older Android versions
- **Actual ML Models**: TensorFlow Lite framework ready but needs real models

### ⚡ Performance Features:
- **Adaptive Processing**: 2-second cooldown between analyses
- **Efficient Threading**: Background processing with coroutines
- **Memory Management**: Proper bitmap cleanup and recycling
- **Battery Optimization**: Intelligent capture scheduling

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Service Won't Start
**Solution**: 
- Check accessibility service is enabled in system settings
- Grant overlay permission if prompted
- Restart the app after enabling accessibility

### Issue: No Blur Overlays Appear
**Check**:
- Look for face detection logs
- Verify overlay window permission granted
- Check if content analysis is running in logs

### Issue: High CPU/Memory Usage
**Action**:
- Verify capture delay is at least 1000ms
- Check for processing cooldown in logs
- Monitor for memory leaks in detection pipeline

### Issue: Crashes on Startup
**Debug**:
- Check Hilt dependency injection errors
- Verify all required permissions granted
- Look for initialization failures in logs
